I would like uBlock to add a whitelistmode for graphics, so when u
activate the picker mode for it, all graphical elements have a
green frame, if you click on a graphical element it will be shown
as red frame and not be included in the whitelist this pickermode
creates for the selected domain/site. That way the user can get rid
of graphical elements that are hidden inside containers, that do
have changing names or appearence. The only option to get rid of
those so far is by blocking all graphics in uMatrix which destroys
the webdesign significantly.
